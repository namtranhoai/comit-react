# Lessons + Exercises

Each folder here contains a different challenge that you need to complete. It is important to follow each exercise in order as they all build upon the knowledge gained in the previous ones.

## Prerequisites

Do these steps only once

1. Download SourceTree from [https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
2. Open SourceTree and sign in (you will need to create a bitbucket account)
3. Create a repository on GitHub called `comit-react-2019`
4. Create a folder on your desktop called `comit-react-2019`
5. Drag that folder into SourceTree and click "Create" when prompted

## How to submit an exercise

1. Make sure you have your latest changes from `master`
2. Read the `.md` file that is inside the lesson folder to learn the requirements
3. Create a folder with the title of the lesson that you are on inside your `comit-react-2019` folder (e.g. `comit-react-2019/02-html-blocks`)
4. Create any required files for the exercise within that folder you just created
5. Commit your code (often!)
6. Push your changes to your GitHub repo
